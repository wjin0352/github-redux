first assignment you'll take a look at Redux actions. Actions are used in your app to signal that you want the state to be updated in some way. Next you'll look at reducers. You can think of reducers as action handlers. They take any new actions, and make the appropriate changes to the state. Here you'll also look at Redux stores, which are used as a central place to store your application's state, and how you can dispatch actions to make them update a store.

Next, you'll take a look at how to use Redux from within the context of React components. You'll see how to pass parts of your state into a component as props, and how to dispatch actions from within a component.

Finally, you'll take a look at how to handle asynchronicity in a Redux architecture, looking at how you can make AJAX calls and have your UI update accordingly.
